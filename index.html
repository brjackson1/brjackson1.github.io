    <h2>Kincade Fire</h2>
    <p>The Kincade wildfire burned in Sonoma County, California USA. It started northeast of Geyserville on October 23, 2019 due to an extreme wind event, and burned about 77,758 acres (31,468 ha) of land until it was finally contained on November 6, 2019. The fire was the largest of the 2019 California wildfire season, and also the largest wildfire ever to occur in Sonoma County.<br><br> Kincade threatened over 90,000 structures and caused widespread evacuations throughout Sonoma County, including the communities of Geyserville, Healdsburg, and Windsor. The majority of Sonoma County and parts of Lake County were under evacuation warnings. The fire started when a 230,000 volt transmission line failed near the point of origin, just before power was about to be shut off in the area. On October 26, PG&E began shutting off power in an attempt to prevent additional fires, leaving an estimated three million people without power. More than 5,000 firefighters, from California and neighboring states, were brought in to battle the Kincade Fire.  21 shelters were opened for evacuees, many families chose to stay with friends and family or sleep in cars or RVs. </p>
