    <h2>Maria Fire</h2>
    <p>The Maria wildfire burned the south of the community of Santa Paula in the area of Somis, California on the top of South Mountain in Ventura County. 
	The fire ignited in the evening hours of Thursday, October 31, 2019 and consumed well over 4,000 acres (16 km2) within its first hours of burning.[2]
  Despite the aggressive initial attack by first responders, the fire exploded rapidly due to a strong Santa Ana wind event that was occurring in the area during its ignition.<br>
  <br>
  On the eve of Thursday, October 31, at 6:13 pm, the Maria fire was reported burning at the top of South Mountain between Santa Paula and Somis and was seen making an 
  aggressive run southwest towards the community of Somis as the fire expanded throughout that evening. Heavily influenced by 20-30 mph winds within the canyons, the fire
   became a full scale conflagration within its first several hours of burning, growing from 50 to 750 acres inside an hour, to over 4,000 acres (16 km2) by 9:45 pm.
    The fire worked its way north towards Santa Paula in the Santa Clara River Valley, whose topography can serve as a wind tunnel for Santa Ana winds. Mandatory evacuations
     were ordered for a wide swath of over 1,800 homes surrounding the fire area, affecting over 7,500 residents.</p>
