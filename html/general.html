                <h1>Causes of Wildfires in California</h1>
                <p>There have been five main reasons for growing severity of wilfires.<br>
				1. Rising Temperatures which increases the evaporation and ultimately makes the land drier. <br> 2. Shorter Winters which means
there is less snow and that releases a smaller amount of melting snow in the spring which also dries the soil and vegetation.<br> 
3. More Pests which is a result of shorter winters kill and weaken millions of trees. <br> 4. Drought which is a reduction in precipitation over an extended period.
It is most people's biggest climate change worry. Climate change creates more severe droughts through a vicious cycle. Greenhouse gas emissions 
trap heat, causing air temperatures to increase. The hot air absorbs more moisture, resulting in less rain. Hotter air also increases evaporation 
from lakes and rivers, reducing water sources. Without rainfall, the plants that retain moisture in the soil die. The bare earth creates even drier 
conditions. When it does rain, water just runs off without absorbing into the water table. Dead vegetation, warmer air, and decreased rainfall also
 increase the frequency and severity of wildfires.  <br> 5. Fire Suppression which results in putting out fires and allowing even more trees to grow when
 there are not even enough nutrients to support their growth and the trees grow thin and weak.<br> <br>
